# iGED_new_repo

This repository is part of the work made during summer 2020 as part of MISTI Mexico,
and the team at Global Ecosystem Dynamics Initiative - MIT.

This repository contains files performing data analysis and visualization 
on networks representing innovation-driven ecosystems in cities accross a number of countries. As of 09/01/2020, 
the analysis is performed on the cities of Buenos Aires, Mexico City, 
Santiago de Chile, Sao Paulo, Montevideo, Madrid, Valencia, Oaxaca, Pachuca, Aguascalientes,
and Guadalajara.   

Part of the analysis consisted in observing correlational information, based on a Data Base collected by GED - MIT. 
This Data Base contains information from a total of 106 countries, regarding Socioeconomic Development Indicators, as well as Anthropological Indicators, in particular Hofstede Dimensions. 

Another part of the analysis supports the study of an empirically determined formula which can describe the *health* of an economic system, based on its representation as a network, or a graph. The Methodology of this study is described in detail in `5_random_graphs_script.ipynb` and `6_random_network_analysis.ipynb`, and consists on the application of a series of proposed formulas on a collection of synthetically generated graphs with controlled variations in construction parameters, so as to determine which metric is most *efficient* in determining which graph has a stronger colaboration structure than another. 


## File extensions

The main extensions of the files saves in this repository include:

* `.ipynb`
* `.csv`
* `.png`
* `.gephi`, and
* `.graphml`. 

## Installation of Software

Applications such as [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual),
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/) might be required in order to run
the Python Notebook files. In particular, to be able to view and interact with `.gephi` files, it will be necessary to download [Gephi](https://gephi.org/users/download/).  

## Contributing
We welcome pull requests, as well as contributions from collaborators and change suggestions. 
In the case of a major change suggestion, please open an issue first.

Please do not modify any file within the folder with name `Ecosystems_from_GED`, as it 
contains original information from the DataSource.
